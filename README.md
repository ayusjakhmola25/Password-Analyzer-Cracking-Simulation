## ✨ Features That Empower You 

Our tool is divided into two powerful, interconnected sections, each designed to educate and inform.

### 🔬 Password Strength Analyzer: Your Digital Security Report

Get instant, comprehensive feedback on your password's resilience.

| Feature | Description |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **5-Point Scoring** | Evaluates passwords against 5 critical criteria: **Length ($\ge 8$), Uppercase, Lowercase, Digit, Symbol.** |
| 🏆 **Intuitive Tiers** | Categorizes strength as **Strong** 🟢, **Moderate** 🟠, or **Weak** 🔴 for quick understanding.             |
| ⏳ **Real-time Crack Time** | Calculates theoretical **Entropy** and estimates brute-force time using modern hardware assumptions.      |
| 💾 **Dynamic Dictionary** | Every analyzed password is **automatically saved** to `password.txt`, enhancing future simulations!        |
| 📚 **Data Structure Demo** | Witness the practical application of a **History Queue** (`collections.deque`) and a **Stack Simulation**. |

### ⚡ Cracking Simulation: The Race Against Time

Understand the efficiency of password attacks by seeing them in action.

* 🚀 **Algorithm Showdown:** Visually compare **Linear Search** ($O(n)$ - brute-force) against **Binary Search** ($O(\log n)$ - optimized) on our dynamic dictionary.
* ⏱️ **Performance Metrics:** Witness the dramatic difference in **"Number of Attempts"** and **"Time Taken"** between algorithms. It's a clear lesson in computational efficiency!

## 🎯 How To Use 

### 📊 Strength Analyzer

1.  Navigate to the **Strength Analyzer** tab.
2.  Type any password you wish to evaluate into the input field.
3.  Click **"Analyze Password"**.
4.  Observe its detailed **Strength Rating**, **Estimated Crack Time**, and watch it automatically appear in your **History Queue** and the internal dictionary!

### ⚙️ Cracking Simulation

1.  Switch to the **Cracking Simulation** tab.
2.  Enter a password. (For best results, use a password already in `password.txt` – either a default one or one you just analyzed).
3.  Click **"Start Simulation"**.
4.  Witness the powerful visual comparison as Linear Search and Binary Search race to find your password, highlighting the stark difference in efficiency!
